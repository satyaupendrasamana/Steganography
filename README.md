# Image Encryption and Decryption Tool  
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

A Python-based project demonstrating image encryption and decryption using the **Fernet cryptography algorithm**.  
This project was developed as part of a **Cybersecurity Internship at APSSDC** to showcase practical encryption implementation skills.

---

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the principles of **image encryption and decryption** using Python.  
It secures image files by encrypting them with a custom algorithm and provides a corresponding decryption process to restore the original image.
